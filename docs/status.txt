Project Status
==============

Current state: Specification and design.

Active work includes:
- Formalizing intent grammar
- Defining canonical IR
- Documenting semantic divergence handling

No implementation is published yet by design.
Early commits prioritize correctness of abstraction
over premature code.

This repository will evolve incrementally.
